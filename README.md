# User Story

```md
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

# <a name= descript>Description</a>
This project tasked us with creating a usable day planner that could help staying organized. It allows the user to accurately set appointments/reminders for the day with accurate time and date as well as the ability to remove when completed. This app also saves the user data upon closing through local storage
